abstract: Abstract Drawing upon the well-documented impact of long-term heart rate
  variability biofeedback (HRVB) on psychophysiological responses, this study seeks
  to explore the short-term effects arising from a single HRVB session during and
  after paced breathing exercise. The research aligns with the neurovisceral integration
  model, emphasizing the link between heart rate variability (HRV) levels and cognitive
  performance. Therefore, a randomized controlled trial employing a between-subjects
  design was conducted with 38 participants. Each participant was assigned to either
  the paced breathing intervention group or the spontaneous breathing control group.
  The study assessed various parameters such as cardiac vagal tone, evaluated through
  vagally mediated HRV measures, and working memory, measured using the N-back task.
  Additionally, participants’ affective states were assessed through self-reported
  questionnaires, specifically targeting attentiveness, fatigue, and serenity. The
  results notably reveal enhancements in the working memory task and an elevated state
  of relaxation and attention following the HRVB session, as evidenced by higher averages
  of correct responses, serenity and attentiveness scores. However, the findings suggest
  that this observed improvement is not influenced by changes in cardiac vagal tone,
  as assessed using a simple mediation analysis. In conclusion, this study presents
  promising insights into the impact of a single HRVB session, laying the foundation
  for future research advancements in this domain.
