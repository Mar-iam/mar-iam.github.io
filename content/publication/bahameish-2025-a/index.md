abstract: Augmented reality (AR) technology has shown promise in facilitating vocabulary learning for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study employed a single-subject research design with a withdrawal approach to investigate the effectiveness of an AR mobile application, in enhancing vocabulary learning performance among children with ASD. Nine participants aged 8â€“12 years diagnosed with mild ASD were recruited from a local special needs center. The study consisted of four phases: familiarization, baseline, intervention, and maintenance. Quantitative measures included correct response rates, percentage of data exceeding the median (PEM), and response time, complemented by qualitative behavioral observations. Results revealed substantial individual variability, with some participants exhibiting significant improvements in vocabulary learning performance during the intervention and maintenance phases, as evidenced by increased correct responses and high PEM values. Other participants showed more moderate improvements or minimal changes. Response time data indicated minimal differences, except for one participant who demonstrated remarkably faster response time post-intervention. Behavioral observations highlighted factors influencing engagement and learning, such as sustaining attention, personalization through interest-based content, and the potential benefits of interacting with 3D models. These findings suggest that while AR interventions can effectively support vocabulary learning for children with ASD, their effectiveness may depend on tailoring strategies to individual learner characteristics and needs within this heterogeneous population.
